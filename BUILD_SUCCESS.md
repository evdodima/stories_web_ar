# ✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL!

## 🎉 Your WASM Module is Ready!

The WebAR engine has been successfully compiled to WebAssembly.

---

## 📦 What Was Built

```
public/wasm/
├── webar_engine.wasm  (2.5 MB)  - WebAssembly binary with C++ + OpenCV
└── webar_engine.js    (87 KB)   - Emscripten glue code for JS bridge
```

---

## ✅ What Was Done

1. **Built OpenCV 4.8.0** for Emscripten
   - Disabled TBB and ITT to avoid compile errors
   - Only included needed modules (core, imgproc, features2d, video, calib3d)
   - Static libraries created in `wasm/opencv/`

2. **Compiled C++ AR Engine** to WASM
   - AREngine - Pipeline coordinator
   - FeatureDetector - BRISK detection & matching
   - OpticalFlowTracker - Lucas-Kanade tracking
   - TargetManager - Target database
   - MemoryPool - Resource pooling
   - API bindings - Embind JavaScript interface

3. **Fixed Build Issues**
   - Removed invalid `-s USE_OPENCV=1` flag (not available in Emscripten 4.x)
   - Enabled RTTI and exceptions for Embind
   - Added `-s USE_ZLIB=1` for OpenCV dependencies
   - Linked against all required OpenCV static libraries

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test in Browser

Server is running at: **http://localhost:8000**

Open in browser:
```
http://localhost:8000/index-wasm.html
```

### 2. Check Console

Press F12 in browser, check Console tab.

You should see:
```
[ARBridge] WASM runtime initialized
[ARBridge] Initialized successfully
```

### 3. Load Target Database

The app will try to load `target_database.json`. Make sure you have target data ready.

### 4. Test with Camera

Click "Start AR Experience" and allow camera access.

## 📊 Performance

**File Sizes:**
- WASM: 2.5 MB (uncompressed)
- JS Glue: 87 KB

**Expected Performance:**
- Desktop: 10-20ms per frame (50-100 FPS)
- Mobile: 25-50ms per frame (20-40 FPS)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### WASM fails to load in browser

**Check:**
1. Server is running: `http://localhost:8000`
2. Open correct URL: `index-wasm.html` (not `index.html`)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify files exist: `ls -lh public/wasm/`

### Camera not working

**Check:**
1. HTTPS or localhost (getUserMedia requires secure context)
2. Camera permissions granted
3. No other app using camera

### No tracking results

**Check:**
1. Target database loaded successfully
2. Targets have valid descriptors
3. Camera is pointing at known target
4. Lighting is adequate

## 📝 Important Notes

### OpenCV Source

You can **delete** `wasm/opencv-src/` to save space:
```bash
rm -rf wasm/opencv-src
```

The built libraries in `wasm/opencv/` are all you need for future builds.

### Rebuilding

If you change C++ code:
```bash
npm run clean       # Clean build artifacts
npm run build:wasm  # Rebuild (fast, ~30 seconds)
```

You don't need to rebuild OpenCV unless you delete `wasm/opencv/`.

### OpenCV Rebuild

If you need to rebuild OpenCV:
```bash
cd wasm
rm -rf opencv opencv-src
./build-opencv.sh   # Takes ~10 minutes
```
