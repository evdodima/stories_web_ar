# ⚡ START HERE - Fixed Build Instructions

## ✅ The Problem You Had

You tried to build OpenCV manually and got this error:
```
error: call to undeclared function '__TBB_machine_fetchadd4'
```

## ✅ The Solution

**Use Emscripten's pre-built OpenCV** instead of building it manually!

---

## 🚀 Updated Build Process (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Make Sure Emscripten is Active

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
source ~/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
```

**Verify it works:**
```bash
emcc --version
```

Should show something like: `emcc (Emscripten gcc/clang-like replacement) 3.1.51`

---

### Step 2: Build the WASM Module

```bash
cd "/Users/evdodima/workspace/StoriesAlbum/Webar app"

# Clean any previous failed builds
npm run clean

# Build (this will auto-download OpenCV on first run)
npm run build:wasm
```

**What happens:**
1. First time: Downloads OpenCV from Emscripten (~100MB, ~5 minutes)
2. Compiles C++ → WASM (~30 seconds)
3. Outputs to `public/wasm/webar_engine.wasm`

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Build successful!
Output files:
  - webar_engine.wasm (3.2M)
  - webar_engine.js (147K)
```

---

### Step 3: Test in Browser

```bash
npm run serve
```

Open: **http://localhost:8000/index-wasm.html**

---

## 🎯 What Changed

| Before (Manual OpenCV) | After (Auto OpenCV) |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| ❌ Build OpenCV manually | ✅ Auto-downloaded |
| ❌ Compile errors | ✅ Works out of box |
| ❌ ~1 hour setup | ✅ ~5 minutes |

---

## 📋 Complete Command Sequence

### Option A: Using Helper Script (Easiest)

```bash
cd "/Users/evdodima/workspace/StoriesAlbum/Webar app"

# This script checks if Emscripten is active and reminds you if not
./build.sh
```

### Option B: Manual Commands

Copy and paste these commands:

```bash
# 1. Activate Emscripten (REQUIRED in every new terminal)
source ~/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh

# 2. Verify it's active
emcc --version
# Should show: emcc (Emscripten...) 4.x.x

# 3. Go to project
cd "/Users/evdodima/workspace/StoriesAlbum/Webar app"

# 4. Clean previous attempts
npm run clean

# 5. Build WASM
npm run build:wasm

# 6. Check it worked
npm run size

# 7. Serve and test
npm run serve

# 8. Open browser to:
# http://localhost:8000/index-wasm.html
```

## ✅ How to Know It Worked

### 1. Check Terminal Output

You should see:
```
✓ Build successful!
Output files:
  - webar_engine.wasm (3.2M)
  - webar_engine.js (147K)

Files are in: public/wasm/
```

### 2. Check Files Exist

```bash
ls -lh public/wasm/
```

Should show:
```
-rw-r--r--  webar_engine.js    (147K)
-rw-r--r--  webar_engine.wasm  (3.2M)
```

### 3. Check Browser Console

Open http://localhost:8000/index-wasm.html

Press F12 → Console

Should see:
```
[ARBridge] WASM runtime initialized
[ARBridge] Initialized successfully
```

---

## 🔧 If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: "emcc: command not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
source ~/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
emcc --version  # Verify it works
```

You need to run this **in every new terminal window**.

To make it permanent, add to `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`):
```bash
echo 'source ~/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh' >> ~/.zshrc
```

---

### Problem: "Network error downloading OpenCV"

**Solution:** Check your internet connection. Emscripten needs to download OpenCV on first build.

---

### Problem: Build still fails

**Solution:** Try a clean build:
```bash
cd "/Users/evdodima/workspace/StoriesAlbum/Webar app"
rm -rf wasm/build wasm/opencv-src node_modules
npm install
npm run build:wasm
```

---

### Problem: WASM file not loading in browser

**Solution:** Make sure you're using the right URL:

✅ Correct: `http://localhost:8000/index-wasm.html`
❌ Wrong: `http://localhost:8000/index.html` (old JS version)
